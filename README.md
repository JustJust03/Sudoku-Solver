# Sudoku-Solver
A pygame gui, where you can play sudoku in and solve the board.

In this gui you can create your own boards, by selecting the emtpy board, than filling in your items by selecting the cell you want to type in,
and than saving the board by hitting escape and click save.
Now you need to fill in a name in the console, and you're all set and done.

Some features are:\
By clicking a cell 2 times you enter the footnote state. Here you can add some footnotes.\
You can navigate your selected cell trough the board with wasd, the arrows, tab and return.\
When you enter the paused screen you can quit back to the main menu, solve the board, save your board and restart the sudoku.\
You can undo your fill in by hitting backspace.

If you find any bugs, have any features I could add or want to colaberate with me, feel free to contact me:\
